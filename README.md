The important function - gameLogic() is left to be written. <br />

<<<<<<< HEAD
To run this file you will need g++ version 12.2.0

Next steps ->
Write the gameLogic() function.
Write the functions in seperate files.
Add a new fruit which is of 5 points and appears after every 5 normal fruit and appears only for 7 seconds.
Test a makefile for this if possible.

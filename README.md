# Snake_Game
This is a classic snake game built on top of C++. It's can be played on CMD.  <br />

There are three fucntions currently -> <br />
    1. gameSetup() -> This initializes my game state. <br />
    2. Box() -> This function draws the layout everytime in repeat. Its the basic layout of the game and has the snake and fruit updated everytime. <br />
    3. KeyBoard_IP() -> This function accepts the keyboard input. <br />

The important function - gameLogic() is left to be written. <br />

To run this file you will need g++ version 12.2.0 <br />

Next steps ->  <br />
Write the gameLogic() function. <br />
Write the functions in seperate files. <br />
Add a new fruit which is of 5 points and appears after every 5 normal fruit and appears only for 7 seconds. <br />
Test a makefile for this if possible. <br />
